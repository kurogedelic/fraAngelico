fraAngelico
===========

fraAngelico is open-source and most hackable synthesizer ever and that is also why we call it true digital!

##How it works
fraAngelico 8-bit PWM digital synth is also unique by the means of its sound generation. It does not use any D/A convertor but the sound is generated by just one digital output pin using Pulse With Modulation which means that by fast changing of different lenghts of pulses we can make different output voltages. Resolution of this technique to achieve different voltage levels is 8-bit but in the true essence the output form the synth is just 1-bit because the output pin does jus 1 or 0 which makes distinctive digital character to its sound.
Despite this puristic and minimalistic approach to sound generation, FraAngelico is able to make wide range of different sound colours from powerfull bass to glitchy noises as well as complex rhithmic structures.
This unprocessed raw digital output can be also synchronised with any MIDI device through its MIDI input.

The soundcore of fraAngelico is based on Auduino project by tinker.it. Thank you for inspiration!
